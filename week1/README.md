## a) fastest non moving speed

find the fastest speed for the square to move across the screen and have the motion be imperceptible. Time how long it takes for the square to move across the screen and measure the physical (not pixel) distance. What is this speed in inches/second ? for kicks, What is it in in mph?

## b) fastest still perceptible speed

find the fastest speed for the square to move across the screen and have the motion be still perceived as continuous (not discrete jumps). Time how long it takes for the square to move across the screen and measure the physical (not pixel) distance. What is this speed in inches/second ? What is this rate in mph?

## c) click to change pta and ptb

make an application where whenever you click, you change either the ptA position or the ptB position to the mouse position, alternating every time you click.

## d) shaper controlls something else besides position

Make the shape code control another property of the object, such as its size or color.  Make the nicest composition that you can.  Try to make it elegant and organic.

(for the xeno code)

## e) multiple xenos

make a series of xeno objects which follow the mouse, each at different rates. give them slightly different colors so that you can perceive them as independent objects.   you will have to modify the rectangle object so that they can have unique colors.

##f) multiple xenos trail

If you are really feeling like showing off, make an array of xeno objects where the first element follows the mouse, the second element follows the first, the third follows the second, etc.

##g) shapers via penner

in class, we used powf to shape a linear signal.  there are more advanced ways to do this (for easing and out, and for snap to, etc).  Some of these have been collected by robert penner as “easing equations”.  some folks have ported this from AS to c++, you can find them here & here  (I'll add these links to the blog, but google cppPennerEasing and ofxEasingFunc).  Also google "golan shaper function" he's agressive catalogued alot of these.
